## My projects ##

[**Trello-clone**](https://clonetrello.netlify.app/home) - This application is similar to Trello. Link to [deploy](https://clonetrello.netlify.app/home), [repository](https://github.com/Alexkhokhlow/rs-clone) and server [repository](https://github.com/Alexkhokhlow/server). Sockets are implemented in the project, so changes on the board can be viewed by several users in real time. Due to the fact that the server is free, sometimes there is a delay.
 
[**Online store**](https://alexkhokhlow-online-store.netlify.app/) - This is an online store site. There is a page with a product, each product has its own page and there is a basket where you can interact with the product. There is also a form of payment.
